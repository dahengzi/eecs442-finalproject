\section{Introduction}

Write the introduction here.  introduce the problem you want to solve, expain why it is important to solve it; and indicate the method you used to solve it. add a concept figure showing the overall idea behind the method you are presenting. You can cite like this \cite{Hays:2007, Karger:1992, Avidan:2007, Torralba:2006, Perez:2003}, using entries from the bibliography.bib file.
